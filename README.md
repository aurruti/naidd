# Nåidd
Nåidd is a domestic server project. Currently a work in progress, it is envisioned as base for a home-based server running limitted functions from web-hosting to personal projects. The ultimate goal is to be able to run such a simple deployment in any old hardware that one might have at home, as long as it can run Linux and have basic capabilities.

## Acknowledgements
The name Nåidd is the word in Skolt Sámi to refer to traditional "shamans" in Sámi religion. I have chosen this name as a way to recognize and honour the Sámi community and specially its language/s, currently endagered, facing a battle against extintion. I have been, however, unable to engage with the Sámi community as much as I wished. If you are part of the community and feel this is a cultural appropiation, and/or in any way disrespectful or out of place, please do contact me.
